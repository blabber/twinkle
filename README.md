Project Twinkle
===============

A board pulsating 7 LED wires. It's only purpose is to look nice.

Notes
-----
* The ATtiny2313 used in this project is oversized but I had a few spare units
  in my box, so I decided to use one of these.
* The LED wires include a series resistor, so you won't find them on the board.
